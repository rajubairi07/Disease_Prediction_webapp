panic disorder,"Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurring severe panic attacks. It may also include significant behavioral changes lasting at least a month and of ongoing worry about the implications or concern about having other attacks. The latter are called anticipatory attacks (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as agoraphobia (fear of public places) although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted therefore an individual may become stressed anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur. Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition or chemical imbalance. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic stressors which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days weeks or months panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense. Panic attacks can occur in children as well as adults. Panic in young people may be particularly distressing because children tend to have less insight about what is happening and parents are also likely to experience distress when attacks occur. , Source: Wikipedia"

It is the most common birth defect regarding male genitalia. In unique cases cryptorchidism can develop later in life often as late as young adulthood. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first ye    ar of life (the majority within three months) making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism is distinct from monorchism the condition of having only one testicle. , Source: Wikipedia"

eating disorder,"Eating disorders are conditions defined by abnormal eating habits that may involve either insufficient or excessive food intake to the detriment of an individual's physical and mental health. Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are the most common specific forms in the United Kingdom. Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified. Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging. Purging can include self-induce vomiting over-exercising and the usage of diuretics enemas and laxatives. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss. Though primarily thought of as affecting females (an estimated 5–10 million being affected in the U.K.) eating disorders affect males as well. An estimated 10 – 15% of people with eating disorders are males (Gorgan 99.(an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected). Although eating disorders are increasing all over the world among both men and women there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western world who are at the highest risk of developing them and the degree of westernization increases the risk. Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder. The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well. Interactions between motivational homeostatic and self-regulatory control processes are involved in eating behaviourwhich is a key component in eating disorders. , Source: Wikipedia"

Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight create distinctive facial stigmata damage neurons and brain structures which can result in psychological or behavioral problems and cause other physical damage. The main effect of FAS is permanent central nervous system damage especially to the brain. Developing brain cells and structures can be malformed or have development interrupted by prenatal alcohol exposure; this can create an array of primary cognitive and functional disabilities (including poor memory attention deficits impulsive behavior and poor cause-effect reasoning) as well as secondary disabilities (for example predispositions to mental health problems and drug addiction). Alcohol exposure presents a risk of fetal brain damage at any point during a pregnancy since brain development is ongoing throughout pregnancy. , Source: Wikipedia"

cysticercosis,"Cysticercosis refers to tissue infection after exposure to eggs of Taenia solium the pork tapeworm. The disease is spread via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food and water and is primarily a food borne disease. After ingestion the eggs pass through the lumen of the intestine into the tissues and migrate preferentially to the brain and muscles. There they form cysts that can persist for years. In some cases the cysts will eventually cause an inflammatory reaction presenting as painful nodules in the muscles and seizures when the cysts are located in the brain. Symptomatic disease from Taenia solium cysts in the brain is referred to as neurocysticercosis and is the most common tapeworm infection of the brain worldwide. Cysticercosis should be differentiated from taeniasis: carriage of the adult tapeworm in the intestine (which is through ingestion of cysts in an intermediate host not the ingestion of the eggs as in cysticercosis). These represent two different stages of the parasite’s life cycle. Though both forms of infection can potentially occur in the same individual at the same timethey are distinct disease entities and have different treatments and potential outcomes. , Source: Wikipedia"

pulmonary eosinophilia,"Also known as Eosinophilic Pneumonia Eosinophilic Pneumonitisand Andrews Syndrome  ,Eosinophilia is a condition in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds 0.45×109/L (450/μl). Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. Several causes are known with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitosis. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC) but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition though in idiopathic eosinophilia the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. Eosinophilia is not a disorder unless it is idiopathic. , Source: Wikipedia"

normal pressure hydrocephalus,"Also known as NPH and Hakim Syndrome  ,Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) also termed symptomatic hydrocephalus occurs when there is an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) due to an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain which can cause ventriculomegaly. The ICP gradually falls but still maintains a slightly elevated level and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 150 to 200 mmH2O. Measurements of ICP therefore are not usually elevated. Because of this equilibration patients do not exhibit the classic signs that accompany increased intracranial pressure such as headache nausea vomiting or altered consciousness although some studies have shown pressure elevations to occur intermittently. However the enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient. The classic symptom triad (gait disturbance urinary incontinence and dementia or mental decline) was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965. NPH is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease or dementia due to its chronic nature and nonspecific presenting symptoms . Although the exact mechanism is unknownnormal-pressure hydrocephalus is thought to be a form of communicating hydrocephalus with impaired CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid granulations. , Source: Wikipedia"

Panic attacks usually begin abruptly may reach a peak within 10 minutes but may continue for much longer if the sufferer had the attack triggered by a situation from which they are not able to escape. In panic attacks that continue unabated and are triggered by a situation from which the sufferer desires to escape some sufferers may make frantic efforts to escape which may be violent if others attempt to contain the sufferer. Some panic attacks can subside on their own over the next several hours. Often those afflicted will experience significant anticipatory anxiety and limited symptom attacks in between attacks in situations where attacks have previously occurred. The effects of a panic attack vary. Some notably first-time sufferers may call for emergency services. Many who experience a panic attack mostly for the first time fear they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown. Experiencing a panic attack has been said to be one of the most intensely frightening upsetting and uncomfortable experiences of a person's life and may take days to initially recover from.

During normal fetal development cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine (colon) to form the networks of nerves called Auerbach's plexus and Meissner's plexus. In Hirschprung's disease the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon. The affected segment of the colon cannot contract and therefore pass stool through the colon creating an obstruction. In most affected people the disorder affects the part of the colon that is nearest the anus. In rare cases the lack of nerve bodies involves more of the colon. In five percent of cases the entire colon is affected. Stomach and esophagus may be affected too.

The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg although varicose veins can occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or reflux). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the calf muscle pump mechanism) against the effects of gravity. When veins become varicose the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem varicose veins can be painful especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling venous eczema skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Life-threatening complications are uncommon. , Source: Wikipedia"
benign kidney cyst,"Also known as Cyst Of Kidney and Simple Renal Cyst  ,Acyst is a fluid-filled sac. There are two types of kidney cysts. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) runs in families. In PKD the cysts take the place of the normal tissue. They enlarge the kidneys and make them work poorly leading to kidney failure. When PKD causes kidneys to fail—which usually happens after many years—people need dialysis or kidney transplantation. About half of people with the most common type of PKD end up with kidney failure. PKD also causes cysts in other parts of the body such as the liver. Symptoms of PKD include Pain in the back and lower sides Headaches Urinary tract infections Blood in the urine Doctors diagnose PKD with imaging tests and family history. Treatments include medications and when people with PKD develop kidney failure dialysis or kidney transplants. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) usually happens in people who are on dialysis. Unlike PKD the kidneys are normal sized and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. People with ACKD already have chronic kidney disease when they develop cysts. ACKD often has no symptoms.

hypocalcemia,"Also known as Abnormally Low Blood Calcium Levels  ,In medicine hypocalcaemia (or hypocalcemia) is the presence of low serum calcium levels in the blood usually taken as less than 2.1 mmol/L or 9 mg/dl or an ionized calcium level of less than 1.1 mmol/L or 4.5 mg/dL. It is a type of electrolyte disturbance. In the blood about half of all calcium is bound to proteins such as serum albumin but it is the unbound or ionized calcium that the body regulates. If a person has abnormal levels of blood proteins then the plasma calcium may be inaccurate. The ionized calcium level is considered more clinically accurate in this case. In the setting of low serum albumin (frequently seen in patients with chronic diseases hepatic disease or even long term hospitalization) the formula for corrected calcium is: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin ) where 4.0 represents the average albumin level in g/dL; in SI units: Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = measured total Ca (mmol/L) + 0.02 (40 - serum albumin ) where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L.

presbyopia,"Presbyopia is a condition where with age the eye exhibits a progressively diminished ability to focus on near objects. Presbyopia’s exact mechanisms are not known with certainty; the research evidence most strongly supports a loss of elasticity of the crystalline lens although changes in the lens’s curvature from continual growth and loss of power of the ciliary muscles (the muscles that bend and straighten the lens) have also been postulated as its cause. Like gray hair and wrinkles presbyopia is a symptom caused by the natural course of aging. The first signs of presbyopia – eyestrain difficulty seeing in dim light problems focusing on small objects and/or fine print – are usually first noticed between the ages of 40 and 50. The ability to focus on near objects declines throughout life from an accommodation of about 20 dioptres (ability to focus at 50 mm away) in a child to 10 dioptres at age 25 (100 mm) and levels off at 0.5 to 1 dioptre at age 60 (ability to focus down to 1–2 meters only). The expected maximum and minimum amplitudes of accommodation for a corrected patient of a given age can be determined using Hofstetter's formulas: Expected amplitude (D) = 18.5 - 0.3 x (age in years) Maximum amplitude (D) = 25 - 0.4 x (age in years)Minimum amplitude (D) = 15 - 0.25 x (age in years). , Source: Wikipedia"

There are many different types of collagen protein in each of the body's tissues. Elastin has the capability of stretching and returning to its original length—like a spring or rubber band. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues that attach bone to bone) and skin. In patients with connective tissue diseaseit is common for collagen and elastin to become injured by inflammation.

poisoning due to gas,"Also known as Gas Poisoning  ,Chemical warfare (CW) involves using the toxic properties of chemical substances as weapons. This type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and biological warfare which together make up NBC the military acronym for nuclear biological and chemical (warfare or weapons) all of which are considered weapons of mass destruction (WMD). None of these fall under the term conventional weapons which are primarily effective due to their destructive potential. Chemical warfare does not depend upon explosive force to achieve an objective. Rather it depends upon the unique properties of the chemical agent weaponized. A lethal agent is designed to injure or incapacitate the enemy or deny unhindered use of a particular area of terrain. Defoliants are used to quickly kill vegetation and deny its use for cover and concealment. It can also be used against agriculture and livestock to promote hunger and starvation. With proper protective equipment training and decontamination measures the primary effects of chemical weapons can be overcome. Many nations possess vast stockpiles of weaponized agents in preparation for wartime use. The threat and the perceived threat have become strategic tools in planning both measures and counter–measures. , Source: Wikipedia"

spinal stenosis,"Also known as Spinal Narrowing  ,Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the spinal canal that may occur in any of the regions of the spine. This narrowing causes a restriction to the spinal canal resulting in a neurological deficit. Symptoms include pain numbness paraesthesia and loss of motor control. The location of the stenosis determines which area of the body is affected. With spinal stenosis the spinal canal is narrowed at the vertebral canal which is a foramen between the vertebrae where the spinal cord (in the cervical or thoracic spine) or nerve roots (in the lumbar spine) pass through. There are several types of spinal stenosis: lumbar stenosis and cervical stenosis being the most frequent. While lumbar spinal stenosis is more commoncervical spinal stenosis is more dangerous because it involves compression of the spinal cord whereas the lumbar spinal stenosis involves compression of the cauda equina. , Source: Wikipedia"

It is characterized by intense fear in social situations causing considerable distress and impaired ability to function in at least some parts of daily life. The diagnosis of social anxiety disorder can be of a specific disorder (when only specific social situations are feared) or a generalized disorder. Generalized social anxiety disorder typically involves a persistent intense chronic fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by one's own actions. These fears can be triggered by perceived or actual scrutiny from others. While the fear of social interaction may be recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable overcoming it can be quite difficult. Social anxiety disorder is known to appear at an early age in most cases. 50% of those who develop this disorder have developed it by the age of 11 and 80% have developed it by age 20. This early age of onset may lead to people with social anxiety disorder being particularly vulnerable to depressive illnesses drug abuse and other psychological conflicts. Physical symptoms often accompanying social anxiety disorder include excessive blushing sweating (hyperhidrosis) trembling palpitations and nausea. Stammering may be present along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. An early diagnosis may help minimize the symptoms and the development of additional problems such as depression. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion especially if they are undiagnosed untreated or both; this can lead to alcoholismeating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse. SAD is sometimes referred to as an 'illness of lost opportunities' , Source: Wikipedia"

Full trisomy 13 is caused by nondisjunction of chromosomes during meiosis (the mosaic form is caused by nondisjunction during mitosis). The extra genetic material from chromosome 13 disrupts the normal course of development causing multiple and complex organ defects. Like all nondisjunction conditions (such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome) the risk of this syndrome in the offspring increases with maternal age at pregnancy with about 31 years being the average.

molluscum contagiosum,"Also known as Water Wart  ,Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin or occasionally of the mucous membranes sometimes called water warts. It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it such as a towel clothing or toys. Once someone has the virus the bumps can spread to other parts of their body by touching or scratching a bump and then touching another part of the body. Molluscum can be spread from one person to another by sexual contact. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children sexually active adults and those who are immunodeficient and the infection is most common in children aged one to ten years old. MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body arms groin and legs. It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels. There is evidence that molluscum infections have globally been on the rise since 1966 but these infections are not routinely monitored because they are seldom serious and routinely disappear without treatment. The virus commonly spreads through skin-to-skin contact. This includes sexual contact or touching or scratching the bumps and then touching the skin. Handling objects that have the virus on them (fomites) such as a towel can also result in infection. The virus can spread from one part of the body to another or to other people. The virus can be spread among children at day care or at school. Molluscum contagiosum is contagious until the bumps are gone. Some growths may remain for up to 4 years if not treated. , Source: Wikipedia"
